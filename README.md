Conway's game of life

##### Content
The “game” is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves, or, for advanced “players”, by creating patterns with particular properties.

##### How the game works 
Because the Game of Life is built on a grid of nine squares, every cell has eight neighboring cells,as shown in the given figure. A given cell (i, j) in the simulation is accessed on a grid [i][j], where i and j are the row and column indices, respectively. The value of a given cell at a given instant of time depends on the state of its neighbors at the previous time step.

##### How I do implent it?
1. architecture design with the requirement
2. write document(SBD - Software Blueprint Docuemtn)
3. once I have enough documentations, I did start coding with the well-engineered design.
